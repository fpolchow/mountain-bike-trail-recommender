Through flat to hilly upland pines to mixed hardwood creek bottoms. Wildflowers and plant species can be abundant at certain times of the year. Hiking or biking is allowed and is rated as an easy trail. Wildlife can be observed at any time along the trail because of its remote surrounding forest. Caution should be given if a visitor was to encounter a snake. The best policy is to quietly back away and give it some space. Walk around it if possible, otherwise be patient and let it finish traveling across the trail before proceeding. Valentine Lake is now free of charge except for the camping facilities. Parking at the day-use areas to use the trail is also free. Picnicking, canoeing, camping, birdwatching, and more are all available at Valentine Lake Recreation Complex.</p><div class=\"grey\">source: <a class=\"underline\" href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kisatchie National Forest</a></div>\n",
