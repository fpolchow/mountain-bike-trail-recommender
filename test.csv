The trail starts right at the end of the guard rail on the left, and makes a sharp left. The trail then opens up to some spacious single track. After a short downhill and either opting over or under a large log feature continue straight up to a steady climb. Do not take the first left after the log, it is a dead end trail that ends at the stream. After the initial climb you will be treated to some nice rolling terrain with some punchy climbs and short descents. There are several short optional paths that loop back to the main trail, however they seem to work better if you were headed back to the parking lot instead of away from it. The trail ends at the Croft main road if you stay right, or connects to other trails starting with a fast somewhat steep descent to the left.",93756,"Counter({'hecklr': 3, 'Ccouch5859': 2, 'Sandem01': 2, 'upstatesc-rider': 2, 'Cliffs': 1, 'Brdgossett': 1, 'Travellornicole': 1, 'Htoddsnyder': 1, 'adamreese417': 1, 'kyleo420': 1, 'StrayKat': 1, 'GaetanHemond': 1, 'leachryanb': 1, 'Raymayley7': 1, 'Integra': 1})","Croft State Park
