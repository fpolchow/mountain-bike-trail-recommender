This section of trail has several good views of the lake. There are several uphill and downhill sections of this trail that are moderately steep where the trail is fairly deep due to erosion. After traveling uphill a ways into a large open area the trail turns north and passes through a gated fence. The trail continues to parallel the lake northward and makes its way up and down several hills that are fairly steep and have water bars. The trail again turns east and crosses a minor inlet before turning south and paralleling the lake a very short way from the edge of the water, a few feet in some cases. This short section heading south along the waters edge is rocky and fairly technical, possibly the most technical section of the entire 40L trail. The trail then turns northeast, away from the water. You will pass through another gated fence and continue up and to the right, ignoring several moderately worn paths. Once on top of the open area you will find yourself headed east toward another gated fence. After passing through that gate the trail will turn northeast again, along the fence line. The trail will shortly turn to the east again away from the fence and then toward the south. While riding downhill here keep a look out, at a certain point there is an excellent view of the spillway.
